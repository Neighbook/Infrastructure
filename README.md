# Infrastructure

Code as infrastucture repository for our project.

To ensure scalability and portability of the application, the infrastructure should be containerized using Docker. Kubernetes can be used as the container orchestration tool to manage, scale, and deploy the application across different environments. By using Kubernetes, the application can be easily managed and scaled as per the demand. The infrastructure code should be stored in a separate repository and versioned to ensure consistency and reproducibility across different environments.
